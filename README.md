# Task Bounty Board

## 1. Project Title
**Task Bounty Board - Minimal Clarity Smart Contract**

## 2. Project Description
The Task Bounty Board is a decentralized application that allows users to post bounties for specific tasks and lets others claim them upon completion. It leverages the Stacks blockchain to ensure transparency, trustlessness, and immutability.  
In this minimal version, there are only two main functions:
- **post-bounty**: Allows a user to lock STX in the contract as a bounty for a described task.
- **claim-bounty**: Allows someone to claim the locked bounty after the task is completed.

## 3. Project Vision
The vision is to create a fully decentralized platform where users can create, manage, and fulfill task-based bounties without relying on centralized intermediaries. By using smart contracts, we ensure that payments are automatically released upon claim, and all bounty records are publicly verifiable on-chain.

## 4. Future Scope
- Add support for multiple bounty claimers with milestone-based payouts.
- Add reputation system for bounty posters and claimers.
- Include dispute resolution mechanism in case of disagreements.
- Add off-chain task verification integration with Oracles.
- Create a front-end DApp with wallet integration for easy user interaction.
